    <p class="des">There are many projects based on IoT available on the internet.In today’s blog you will learn about the working of the IoT and MQTT.</p>

    <p class="subdes">IoT(Internet of Things):</p> 
        <p class=des>The IoT or Internet of Things as we know is the connection of many devices and its connectivity with internet,so we can receive and transmit data through internet.</p>

        <p class="subdes">MQTT(Message Queuing Telemetry Transport):</p>
        <p class=des><b>MQTT</b> stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport.The <b>MQTT broker</b> is the server which helps us to transmit and receive data.The MQTT keeps the record of who has subscribed to whom and acts as the middle man.We have to connect our<b> Node MCU </b>or <b>Wemos</b> to internet and then when we use <b>google assistant</b> or <b>google home</b> we send a particular data to the MQTT broker.Our board is also connected to the broker through the internet.So when the data goes to the MQTT broker ,the board understands that the data is changed and according to the data received it acts.For eg:If the data received was <b>‘ON’</b> then the board will turn the light or led on and if the data was <b>‘OFF’</b> then the board will turn the light or led off.All this things can be set by coding the board.</p>

        <p class="des">There are many MQTT brokers you can use like Adafruit.io.To make custom commands for google assistant like ‘turn on the light’ and send data to the broker we can use app like IFTTT(IF This Then That)</p>
